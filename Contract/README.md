## 🌍 Project Vision
To build a **trustless**, **secure**, and **transparent** digital voting system that promotes integrity in elections and empowers voters through blockchain technology.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with **Digital Identity Verification (KYC)** to ensure real-world eligibility.
- **Anonymous voting** using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).
- **Multi-election support** for simultaneous elections.
- **User Interface (Frontend)** using React.js and Web3.js for easy interaction.
- Deployment on **Layer 2 networks** for lower gas fees and scalability.
